However, they only have outdated estimates for how effective individual NPIs were in the first wave. We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe's second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours-such as distancing-which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe's third wave.","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the effectiveness of government interventions against the resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Susan D.

As COVID19 disease control efforts are re-intensified, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these affect the loosening of interventions is crucial. We analyze aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the US and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20-49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one, and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20-49 in the US. Targeting interventions – including transmission-blocking vaccines – to adults aged 20-49 is an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths.","tags":[],"title":"Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-19 epidemics in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["PA Vel’misov","Yu A Tamarova","EP Semenova"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822709,"objectID":"6780b72bf360c60a06c603afcc165f61","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/vel-2021-asymptotic/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:23.423473Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vel-2021-asymptotic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Asymptotic Equations of Gas Dynamics: Qualitative Analysis, Construction of Solutions, and Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Léo Grinsztajn","Elizaveta Semenova","Charles C Margossian","Julien Riou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822706,"objectID":"4a5a4ea251a14ee86d1760b7366fe99e","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/grinsztajn-2021-bayesian/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:22.834268Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grinsztajn-2021-bayesian/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian workflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Swapnil Mishra","Sören Mindermann","Mrinank Sharma","Charles Whittaker","Thomas A Mellan","Thomas Wilton","Dimitra Klapsa","Ryan Mate","Martin Fritzsche","Maria Zambon","Janvi Ahuja","Adam Howes","Xenia Miscouridou","Guy P Nason","Oliver Ratmann","Elizaveta Semenova","Gavin Leech","Julia Fabienne Sandkühler","Charlie Rogers-Smith","Michaela Vollmer","H Juliette T Unwin","Yarin Gal","Meera Chand","Axel Gandy","Javier Martin","Erik Volz","Neil M Ferguson","Samir Bhatt","Jan M Brauner","Seth Flaxman","The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822705,"objectID":"937d95fbf76151496cd2855deca90022","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/mishra-2021-changing/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:22.607055Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mishra-2021-changing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Changing composition of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and rise of Delta variant in England","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elizaveta Semenova$^\\dagger$","Maria Luisa Guerriero","Bairu Zhang","Andreas Hock","Philip Hopcroft","Ganesh Kadamur","Avid M Afzal","Stanley E Lazic"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822705,"objectID":"36c6a137f500e2319fec27005a2ed649","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/semenova-2021-flexible/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:22.493709Z","relpermalink":"/publication/semenova-2021-flexible/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Flexible fitting of PROTAC concentration-response curves with changepoint Gaussian Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["AF Brito$^*$","E Semenova$^*$","G Dudas$^*$","GW Hassler","CC Kalinich","MUG Kraemer","SC Hill","OG Pybus","C Dye","S Bhatt"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822704,"objectID":"0b22d05b908decf10eea49058efb930d","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/brito-2021-global/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:22.382147Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brito-2021-global/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Global disparities in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lewis F.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closure of schools and national lockdowns. We study the impact of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of COVID-19 until the 4th of May 2020 when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries with both individual and shared effects on the reproduction number. Pooling allows more information to be used, helps overcome data idiosyncrasies, and enables more timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters such as the infection fatality rate, does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behavior. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that is incomplete, with systematic biases in reporting, and subject to future consolidation. We estimate that, for all the countries we consider, current interventions have been sufficient to drive the reproduction number $$R_t$$Rt below 1 (probability $$R_tbackslash,$$Rt\u003c 1.0 is 99.9%) and achieve epidemic control. We estimate that, across all 11 countries, between 12 and 15 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4th May, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions and lockdown in particular have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.","tags":[],"title":"Estimating the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrien Todeschini","Xenia Miscouridou","François Caron"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655822703,"objectID":"a2c4bc8b6286ca8977a4486a3f095c7c","permalink":"https://mlglobalhealth.github.io/publication/todeschini-2020-apr/","publishdate":"2022-10-20T12:29:21.912801Z","relpermalink":"/publication/todeschini-2020-apr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Exchangeable random measures for sparse and modular graphs with overlapping communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver Ratmann","Joseph Kagaayi","Matthew Hall","Tanya Golubchick","Godfrey Kigozi","Xiaoyue Xi","Chris Wymant","Gertrude Nakigozi","Lucie Abeler-Dıfmmode\\ddoto\\elseö\\firner","David Bonsall","Astrid Gall","Anne Hoppe","Paul Kellam","Jeremiah Bazaale","Sarah Kalibbala","Oliver Laeyendecker","Justin Lessler","Fred Nalugoda","Larry W.
